# Message Board

This is a Message Board app where client can sign in and post messages, see old messages as well as edit and delete their messages, built with a mock API.

The App is built with React Redux, a mock Api at db.json built with json server fetched with thunks, I've used Redux toolkit for configuring the store and combine reducers.

I will continue on this project, make the put request to work and with enter tab, buildning a backend to register user, authentication and for add, change and delete messages and improve the css.
