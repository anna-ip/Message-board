# Message Board

This app has been generated using `create-react-app`, then cleaned up a little so we have a project with just the elements we need to get started.

Add components in the `src` folder and use them in `src/app.js` to get started.

## Usage
* Install required dependencies with npm: `npm install`
* Start the project: `npm start`
* Start the server with `json-server --watch db.json --port 3004`
